Finally the very prototype of my jekyll blog is finished or i rather called it 'nailed it'.
I designed it by myself using the very basic principle of responsive design, you know that famous meta device-width or something and was inspired by ghost default theme. 

### Why Jekyll?
Because it's free, yeah i am a cheap person, combined with github free hosting plus very cool github.io root  domain it's an easy decision to me. Also it has everything i need to write a technical blog , e.g on board syntax highlighting with pygments.

### Why 7?
There is so many good things about 7. For example:

1. 7 Wonders.
2. 7 OSI layer.
3. 7 Samurai.
4. 7 Eleven.
5. Ultra Seven.
6. Seven Private Ryan.
7. S7even Spielberg.

Ok, just forget the last two. The real reason is because of this year Star Wars 7 release. I am a fan of Star Wars film, not hardcore, but enough. I even named my Thinkpad Laptop as Anathink Padwalker, i'll post about it later. So yeah that's why i choose 7.

### What Next?
Since i've been a backend programmer for too long. My frontend development skills is a bit rusted, there will be UI inconsistency here and there but don't worry i'll regain my lost skill back then i'll fix it for good.

So, stay tuned !
