    <h1>Rmx 7</h1>
    <div class="post-content">
       <p>Finally the very prototype of my jekyll blog is finished or i rather called it 'nailed it'.
I designed it by myself using the very basic principle of responsive design, you know that famous meta device-width or something and was inspired by ghost default theme.</p>

<h3>Why Jekyll?</h3>

<p>Because it's free, yeah i am a cheap person, combined with github free hosting plus very cool github.io root  domain it's an easy decision to me. Also it has everything i need to write a technical blog , e.g on board syntax highlighting with pygments.</p>

<h3>Why 7?</h3>

<p>There is so many good things about 7. For example:</p>

<ol>
<li>7 Wonders.</li>
<li>7 OSI layer.</li>
<li>7 Samurai.</li>
<li>7 Eleven.</li>
<li>Ultra Seven.</li>
<li>Seven Private Ryan.</li>
<li>S7even Spielberg.</li>
</ol>


<p>Ok, just forget the last two. The real reason is because of this year Star Wars 7 release. I am a fan of Star Wars film, not hardcore, but enough. I even named my Thinkpad Laptop as Anathink Padwalker, i'll post about it later. So yeah that's why i choose 7.</p>

<h3>What Next?</h3>

<p>Since i've been a backend programmer for too long, my frontend development skills is a bit rusted, there will be UI inconsistency here and there but don't worry i'll regain my lost skill back then i'll fix it for good.</p>

<p>So, stay tuned !</p>
